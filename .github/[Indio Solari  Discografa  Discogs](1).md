# DTective Forensic Video Analysis Suite For Avid MC: A Powerful Tool for Multimedia Evidence Processing
 
Forensic video analysis is the process of examining and clarifying video evidence for legal purposes. It involves capturing, enhancing, annotating, and presenting video footage that may be relevant to a crime or an incident. Forensic video analysts use specialized software and hardware tools to perform these tasks and produce accurate and reliable results.

One of the most popular and widely used forensic video analysis software is DTective, by Ocean Systems. DTective is a suite of Avid Media Composer AVX plug-ins that provide a comprehensive set of features for forensic video analysis, such as:
 
- SpotLight: For redaction by blurring faces or objects as they move through videos.
- dVeloper: For real-time frame averaging by Region of Interest. This can help reduce noise and enhance details in low-quality videos.
- MAGNIFi: For presentation. This allows the analyst to select a smaller area in the video to display larger, with optional zooming and panning effects.
- arithMATIC: For analysis. This enables the analyst to use subtraction, addition, or difference modes to see the pixel changes before and after an event. This can be useful for detecting shoplifting, tampering, or other suspicious activities.
- dPlex/dPlex Pro: For demultiplexing video. This can help separate the cameras in multiplexed video streams, even with pan-tilt-zoom footage. This can be helpful for cold cases or legacy systems.
- archive-R: A stand-alone application for archiving digital media files into one hashed file. This can help preserve the integrity and chain of custody of the evidence.
- ClearID: A set of image clarification filters that can also be applied to video frames. These include color correction, contrast adjustment, sharpening, deblurring, deinterlacing, and more.

DTective is compatible with Avid Media Composer, which is a professional video editing software that offers a multi-track timeline, a full set of editing tools, and support for various formats of digital video. Avid Media Composer also allows the analyst to create reports, annotations, bookmarks, and export options for the evidence.
 
DTective is an affordable, powerful, and easy to learn forensic video analysis suite that has been used by thousands of law enforcement agencies, forensic labs, and private investigators worldwide. It has been proven to be effective in solving cases involving homicide, robbery, assault, traffic accidents, terrorism, and more.
