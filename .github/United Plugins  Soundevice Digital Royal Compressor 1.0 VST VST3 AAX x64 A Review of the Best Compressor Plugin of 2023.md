If you are looking for a vintage analogue compressor plugin that can add warmth, saturation and character to your tracks, you might want to check out the Royal Compressor by Soundevice Digital. This plugin is inspired by a model of the classic British device from the Beatles era used on hundreds of records since the sixties. It delivers the true vintage analogue sound and feel with just a few knobs and a switchable circuit type.

The Royal Compressor features a vari-mu compression algorithm that reacts to the input signal level and adjusts the compression ratio accordingly. This creates a smooth and natural compression that is suitable for vocals, bass, drums and more. You can also switch between three models of circuitry with different fixed attack times: A (fast), B (medium) and C (slow). The release time is auto-adjusted based on the input signal as well.
 
One of the most interesting features of the Royal Compressor is the automatic gain control (AGC) that keeps the output level constant regardless of how much input gain you add. This allows you to drive the plugin harder and get more saturation without worrying about clipping or volume changes. The saturation amount can be adjusted with the Saturation knob, which adds harmonics and colour to the signal. The saturation algorithm is randomised to emulate the behaviour of real hardware.
 
The Royal Compressor has a simple and intuitive interface that resembles the original hardware unit. It has a large VU meter that shows the input or output level and the amount of gain reduction. It also has a bypass switch and an output level knob. The plugin is CPU-friendly and supports 64-bit audio quality at any sampling rate. It also comes with a second-hand edition for free, which has a limited functionality but adds some extra flavour to your tracks.
 
The Royal Compressor is available for Windows and Mac in VST, VST3, AAX and AU formats. You can buy it from United Plugins for â¬129 or try it for free for 15 days with no limitations. If you are looking for a plugin that can recreate the sound and feel of a classic British compressor with a modern twist, you should definitely give the Royal Compressor a try.

The Royal Compressor has received positive reviews from many users and experts who praised its sound quality, ease of use and versatility. Some of the common applications of the Royal Compressor include adding warmth and presence to vocals, smoothing out synth sounds, enhancing acoustic guitars and adding punch and glue to drum busses. The plugin can also be used creatively to add distortion and character to any sound source.
 
One of the unique features of the Royal Compressor is that it offers three different circuit types that emulate three different hardware units with varying attack times. The A model is the fastest and cleanest, suitable for transparent compression and limiting. The B model is the medium one, with a moderate attack and a more coloured sound. The C model is the slowest and most colourful, ideal for adding richness and depth to your tracks. You can switch between the models with a simple knob and hear how they affect your sound.
 
Another feature that sets the Royal Compressor apart from other plugins is the saturation section, which simulates the valve saturation of the original hardware. The saturation amount can be adjusted with a knob, and it adds harmonics and colour to the signal. The saturation algorithm is randomised to create a realistic and natural effect that varies with each instance. The saturation can be subtle or extreme, depending on your taste and needs.
