Gadar: Ek Prem Katha is a 2001 Hindi film that depicts the romance between a Sikh truck driver and a Muslim girl during the Partition of India in 1947. The film, directed by Anil Sharma and starring Sunny Deol and Ameesha Patel, was a blockbuster hit that broke many box office records and became one of the most-watched Hindi films of all time.
 
The film is loosely based on the real-life story of Boota Singh, a Sikh soldier who fell in love with a Muslim woman named Zainab during the Partition and faced many hardships to be with her. The film portrays the violence and chaos that erupted after the Partition, as well as the religious and social barriers that the lovers had to overcome.

The film begins with Tara Singh (Deol), a truck driver who saves Sakina (Patel), a Muslim girl, from a mob that attacks her at a railway station. He takes her to his home and protects her from the riots. He also helps her find her family, who had left for Pakistan without her. Along the way, they fall in love and get married, despite their different backgrounds and faiths. They have a son named Charanjeet (Utkarsh Sharma).
 
However, their happiness is short-lived when Sakina's father, Ashraf Ali (Amrish Puri), a wealthy politician in Pakistan, comes to India to look for her. He finds her and takes her back to Pakistan, along with Charanjeet. Tara is heartbroken and decides to go to Pakistan to bring them back. He faces many obstacles and dangers in his quest, but he also receives help from some kind-hearted people. He finally reaches Sakina's home and confronts Ashraf Ali, who refuses to let his daughter go with a Sikh.
 
The film ends with a dramatic climax, where Tara fights with Ashraf Ali's men and manages to escape with Sakina and Charanjeet. They reach the border of India and Pakistan, where they are stopped by the Pakistani army. Tara declares that he will not leave without his wife and son, and challenges anyone who tries to stop him. He raises his hand in defiance, holding a small Taj Mahal replica that Sakina had given him as a symbol of their love. The film ends with a voice-over saying that no one knows what happened to them after that.
  
Gadar: Ek Prem Katha was a huge commercial success, becoming the highest-grossing Hindi film of 2001 and one of the highest-grossing films of all time in India.
