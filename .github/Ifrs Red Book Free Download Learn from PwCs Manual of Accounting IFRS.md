- A globally harmonised system: IFRS Accounting Standards establish common rules and principles that aim to standardise and rationalise the presentation of accounting information. This helps to meet the needs of various users of financial statements, such as investors, regulators, creditors and auditors[^1^].
- Easy comparison of company ratings: IFRS Accounting Standards enable cross-border comparisons of financial performance and position of companies that operate in different markets. This facilitates international trade and investment, as well as market efficiency and competition[^1^].
- Prudent management, with safer and less volatile long-term investments: IFRS Accounting Standards promote a balance sheet approach that reflects the economic substance of transactions rather than their legal form. This encourages prudent management of assets and liabilities, as well as more reliable and relevant information for decision-making[^1^].
- Greater transparency of information and better communication: IFRS Accounting Standards require more extensive disclosures than some other accounting standards, such as GAAP. This enhances the transparency and accountability of financial reporting and disclosure practices, as well as the communication between companies and their stakeholders[^1^].
