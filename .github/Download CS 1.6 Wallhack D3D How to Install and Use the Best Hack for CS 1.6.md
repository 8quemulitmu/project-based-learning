## Step 1: Download D3D Wallhack
 
The first step is to download D3D Wallhack from a reliable source. One of the best sources is GitHub, where you can find the source code and the compiled binary of D3D Wallhack for CS 1.6 by BloodSharp[^1^].

To run D3D Wallhack, you need to inject it into the CS 1.6 process using an injector program such as Extreme Injector or Xenos Injector. You can find many injector programs online, but make sure they are safe and virus-free before downloading them.
