# How to Use Addons 3.3.5 WoW Quick DKP to Manage Your Raid Loot
 
If you are a World of Warcraft player who enjoys raiding with your guild or friends, you may have encountered the challenge of distributing loot fairly and efficiently. One way to solve this problem is to use a system called DKP (Dragon Kill Points), which assigns points to each player based on their participation and performance in raids. These points can then be used to bid on items that drop from bosses.
