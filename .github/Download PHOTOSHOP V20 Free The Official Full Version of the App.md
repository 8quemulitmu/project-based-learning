But Photoshop is not a cheap software. It costs US$20.99 per month for a single app subscription, or US$52.99 per month for the whole Creative Cloud suite. If you are on a tight budget, you might be wondering if there is a way to get Photoshop for free.
 
The good news is that you can download a 7-day free trial of Photoshop from Adobe's official website. The free trial is the full version of the app, with all the features and updates included. You can use it for any personal or commercial project without any limitations.
