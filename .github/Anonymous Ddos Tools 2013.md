# Anonymous DDoS Tools 2013: A Review of the Most Popular and Effective Tools for Distributed Denial-of-Service Attacks
  
Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks are a common tactic used by hackers, activists, and cybercriminals to disrupt the normal functioning of a website or a network by overwhelming it with traffic from multiple sources. DDoS attacks can cause significant damage to the target, such as loss of revenue, reputation, or data.

One of the most notorious groups that use DDoS attacks as a form of protest or activism is Anonymous, a decentralized collective of anonymous hackers who have targeted various governments, corporations, and organizations around the world. Anonymous has used DDoS attacks to support various causes, such as anti-censorship, anti-corruption, anti-surveillance, and anti-terrorism.
  
To carry out their DDoS attacks, Anonymous members use various tools that are freely available on the internet. Some of these tools are designed specifically for DDoS purposes, while others are general-purpose network testing or hacking tools that can be used for DDoS as well. In this article, we will review some of the most popular and effective tools that Anonymous has used in 2013 for their DDoS campaigns.
  
## Low Orbit Ion Cannon (LOIC)
  
Low Orbit Ion Cannon (LOIC) is one of the oldest and most widely used tools for DDoS attacks. It was originally developed by Praetox Technologies as a network stress testing tool, but it was later adopted by Anonymous and other hackers for DDoS purposes. LOIC is a simple and easy-to-use tool that allows users to send large amounts of TCP, UDP, or HTTP requests to a target server. LOIC can be run on Windows, Linux, or Mac OS X platforms.
  
LOIC has two modes of operation: manual and automatic. In manual mode, users can specify the target IP address or URL, the port number, the protocol type, and the number of threads to use. In automatic mode, users can join a voluntary botnet called Hive Mind, which is controlled by a central server that instructs all the connected LOIC clients to attack a specific target at the same time. This way, LOIC can generate a massive amount of traffic from multiple sources.

LOIC is effective in generating a large volume of traffic, but it has some drawbacks. First, LOIC does not hide the identity or location of the attacker, as it does not use any proxy or encryption techniques. This makes it easy for the target or law enforcement agencies to trace back the source of the attack and take legal action against the attacker. Second, LOIC can be easily detected and blocked by firewalls or other security measures that can filter out abnormal traffic patterns.
  
## High Orbit Ion Cannon (HOIC)
  
High Orbit Ion Cannon (HOIC) is an upgraded version of LOIC that was developed by Anonymous members in 2012. HOIC is designed to overcome some of the limitations of LOIC and to increase the effectiveness and sophistication of DDoS attacks. HOIC is also a simple and easy-to-use tool that allows users to send large amounts of HTTP requests to a target server. HOIC can be run on Windows platforms only.
  
HOIC has some features that make it more powerful and versatile than LOIC. First, HOIC allows users to customize their HTTP requests by using scripts called boosters. Boosters can modify various parameters of the requests, such as headers, cookies, user-agents, referrers, etc., to make them look more legitimate and diverse. Boosters can also randomize these parameters to avoid detection and blocking by firewalls or other security measures. Second, HOIC allows users to target multiple URLs or domains at the same time by using lists called target files. Target files can contain up to 256 URLs or domains that can be attacked simultaneously by HOIC.
  
HOIC is more effective in generating a large variety and complexity of traffic than LOIC, but it still has some drawbacks. First, HOIC does not hide the identity or location of the attacker either, as it does not use any proxy or encryption techniques either. This makes it easy for the target or law enforcement agencies to trace back the source of the attack and take legal action against the attacker. Second, HOIC requires more resources and bandwidth than LOIC to run effectively.
