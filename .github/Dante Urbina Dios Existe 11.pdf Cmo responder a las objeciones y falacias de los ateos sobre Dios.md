In the book, Urbina examines the classical arguments of Aquinas, Anselm, Leibniz and others, as well as more contemporary ones such as the fine-tuning argument, the moral argument and the argument from religious experience. He also addresses some common objections and challenges to theism, such as the problem of evil, the hiddenness of God and the plurality of religions.
 
Urbina's book is not only a rigorous and comprehensive analysis of the philosophical debate on God's existence, but also a personal testimony of his own journey from atheism to faith. He shares how his intellectual curiosity and search for truth led him to discover the rationality and beauty of the Christian worldview.
 
"Dios Existe" is a valuable resource for anyone who is interested in exploring the philosophical foundations of faith, or who wants to deepen their understanding of the arguments for God's existence. The book is available in PDF format on Urbina's website: [https://danteurbina.com/dios-existe/](https://danteurbina.com/dios-existe/).
  
One of the main themes that Urbina explores in his book is the relationship between reason and faith. He argues that faith is not a blind leap in the dark, but a reasonable response to the evidence and arguments that point to God's existence. He also shows how faith can enrich and illuminate reason, by providing a coherent and meaningful framework for understanding reality.
 
Another theme that Urbina addresses is the relevance and impact of God's existence for human life. He explains how believing in God can answer some of the most fundamental questions that humans have, such as: What is the purpose of life? What is the basis of morality? What is the destiny of the soul? He also demonstrates how believing in God can transform one's attitude and behavior, by inspiring love, hope, gratitude and joy.
